####
The most important script in this folder. This script generates a population of non-straight axon trajectories through an iterative algorithm. These trajectories are advantageous to straight axon trajectories as they help the ANN to better generalize to the axonal trajectories found in the brain. The algorithm can be tuned in several ways. The below image shows a 2d version of the algorithm, as well as an example 3d trajectory and population of 3d trajectories generated with the algorithm.
